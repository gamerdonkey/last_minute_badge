# Crappy Last-Minute DEFCON Badge

For years, I've wanted to design and build my very own badge for DEFCON. But I always put the work off until it is too late. This year, I decided to make a badge, come hell or high water. So I threw together components that I had lying, unused, around the house into something resembling an electronic badge.
